### Hi there 👋

I am Ampersand Paris (she/her/they/them).
<br>
During the day, I am a Front-End Developer, and at night, I am a Performing Artist in the spotlight. I am interested in collaborating on projects with designers and engineers willing to disrupt the status quo for socially driven impacts and committed to developing beautiful and accessible virtual spaces. 

I'm work on freelance projects through FAILSPACE Design Services. FSDS is a design studio I began with a design partner in 2020. Together we design and build websites while providing subsidized rates for artits and non-profits.  

FSDS is currently building two websites that use React for choreographer Bebe Miller.
